        to accept a query of the form "Do you have any genomes with an 'A' at position 100,735 on chromosome 3" (or similar data)
        and responds with one of "Yes" or "No." A site offering this service is called a "beacon". This open web service is designed
        both to be technically simple (so it is easy to implement) and to not return information that could be construed as violating
        anyone's privacy (so there is no good excuse for not implementing it as a public, unrestricted web resource). Within weeks
        of this proposal, Beacons started to crop up. The goal of the data working group is foster the development of more than a
        dozen independent beacons by end of 2014, and in collaboration with the other working groups to gain initial direct experience
        with the barriers to international genetic data sharing through this Beacon project. We call these applications "Beacons"
        because, like the SETI project, many dedicated people have been scanning the universe of human research for signs of willing
        participants in far-reaching data sharing efforts, but despite many assurances of interest, it has remained a dark and quiet
        place. Once your "Beacon" is shining, you can start to take the next steps to add functionality to it, and finding the other
        groups who may help by following their Beacons. A listing of current Beacons is maintained below.</div>
