                                        #### The [Matchmaker Exchange (MME) project](http://www.matchmakerexchange.org/) is focused on building the infrastructure to enable finding similar patients across patient databases, specifically to facilitate the discovery of the genetic causes of rare diseases. It is a federated network of patient databases that are connected through the [Matchmaker Exchange API](http://github.com/ga4gh/mme-apis) which enables patient-level queries based on the phenotypic and genotypic profile of a patient.
