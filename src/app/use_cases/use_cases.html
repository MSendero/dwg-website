      ## Use Cases 
      
      ### Enabling Genomics-Based Patient Risk Assessment: BRCA1 Information Consolidation and Interpretation 
      
      VariantMapper demonstrates how genomics can be integrated into clinical decision support, including BRCA1. Comparing
      patients' DNA variants and those from databases documenting genotype-phenotype association, this use case can alert
      clinicians about potential risk factors. By dynamically binding the knowledge database and patients' genotype, the
      application also allows clinicians to learn more about their patients as the database grows. This project seeks to
      integrate genomic, clinical, and patient questionnaire information for improved breast cancer diagnosis and treatment
      of mutation carrying individuals. A demonstration of VariantMapper, using GA4HGH Read API 0.1, has been implemented
      by a Harvard lab and can be found [here](http://smartgenomics.wikispaces.com/Overview+and+Use+Cases). Other examples
      include the Genomics Advisor and DB EMR (for diabetes) at the Apple iTunes store.

      ### Combining Genomes Across Sites to enabling Research for Cancer and Rare/Undiagnosed Diseases
      
      Tissue-specific somatic
      mutations create many different variations that need large patient samples. Combining genomic information across many
      institutions, via an API, would enable such research to take place. Rare/undiagnosed diseases present a challenging
      problem because a single institution rarely has enough patients to quantify genotype and phenotype links. An example
      of this use case is the new [Undiagnosed Disease Network sponsored by the NIH](http://commonfund.nih.gov/Diseases/index)

      ### Identifying Microorganisms
      
      Microorganisms can be identified based on genetic sequence. For example, tuberculosis
      virulence and drug resistance profiles can be predicted based on the underlying sequences, as is being done by TBResist.
      Host-organism interactions based on genetics can also be analyzed. In order to fully categorize mycobacterial variants,
      it is necessary to develop high-density DNA probe arrays. A recent study reported an array containing all 16S rRNA
      polymorphisms over a 200bp region of a mycobacterial database. This allows for accurate and specific diagnosis of the
      infection.

      ### Predicting Drug Response and Integration with Electronic Medical Records for Research 
      
      Systems such as SMART and
      i2b2 are enabling apps to access clinical and genomic information associated with Electronic Health Records and other
      sources. For example, the Genomics Advisor presents pharmocogenomic information based on patient genetic information.
      Integration with GA4GH is will enable further research into genotype-phenotype links as well as a new generation of
      apps that provide real-time feedback to physicians. For example, physicians can now predict patient response to different
      drugs based on pharmocogenomics. An example is the PREDICT system at Vanderbilt which suggests warfarin dosage based
      on underlying genetic information.

      ### Prenatal Testing 
      
      Prenatal genetic testing has been recorded and researched for nearly two decades. At first its
      use was limited to identifying gender, trisomy 21 and RhD. Recently, focus has turned to using genetic markers to monitor
      development, noting any abnormalities that may have consequences when the baby is born and later in life. An example
      of a currently available, noninvasive prenatal genetic screening test tool is Panorama. It is a tool that can be shared
      and used by a pregnant womanâ€™s provider to give her the most accurate health advice. Panorama works by testing a particular
      set of microdeletions.
